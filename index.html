<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b> Router:</b> Designed a router that handles communications between 2 emulated servers and a client. Router handles ARP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets, and supports wget, ping, and traceroute commands. Implemented longest prefix match and ARP caching. <b> Language: C </b><br></li>
<li><b> Sliding Window Protocol:</b> Implemented the hosts as threads that run on my processor, and simulated the network links between these hosts (threads). Implemented Sliding Window Protocol that uses selective retransmission and cumulative ACK scheme to achieve reliable transmission of data frames and thereby enabling the receiver to populate the entire original message that the sender had sent. <b> Language: C</b><br></li>
<li><b>Taxi Travel Time Prediction Task:</b> Led and developed an MLP Regressor model alongside 2 other developers that is trained on an engineered dataset that incorporates various factors, such as the Type of Call, Local Time in Portugal, Day of the Week, etc. Heavily utilized feature engineering to determine rush-hours and non rush-hours, and the MLP model architecture was built with 4 layers and uses ReLU as an activation function, outputting a single floating point number. Experimented with LSTM models and also a LightGBM model but the MLP Regressor gave us the best results.<b> Language: Python</b><br></li>
<li><b>Compiler:</b> Created a Rust compiler to generate x86-64 assembly for a generic language. Optimized the compiler to reduce the number of assembly instructions and implemented let instructions, binary operators, booleans, conditionals, variable assignment, loops, top-level function definitions, heap allocation, and garbage collection.<b> Language: Rust</b></li>
<li><b>"Yodie":</b> Led and developed a custom processor that supports specific Forward Error Correction (FEC) tasks alongside a team of 2 other developers. The instruction set architecture of our processor featured fixed-length instructions (machine code) 9 bits wide. <b> Languages: System Verilog and Python</b><br></li>
<li><b>"SurfStore":</b> Created a cloud-based file storage service called SurfStore. SurfStore is a networked file storage application that is based on Dropbox, and lets you sync files to and from the “cloud”. Implemented the cloud service, and a client which interacts with the service via gRPC. <b> Language: Go</b><br></li>
<li><b>"TritonHTTP":</b> Built a simple web server that implements a subset of the HTTP/1.1 protocol specifications. Clients connect to a port on the server and use the TritonHTTP protocol to retrieve files from the server. The server reads data from the client to interpret one or more requests. Supports pipelined requests. <b> Language: Go</b><br></li>
<li><b>"Birds of a Feather":</b> Led and developed a Mobile App alongside a team of 3 other developers that uses the new Nearby API to find and make friends in the same class as the user. Implemented filters to shortlist other users based on user preferences and send messages using the Java Nearby API. Focused on using Agile principles, such as Scrum and standups to brainstorm through development and designing. Constantly maintained an organized Github repository. <b> Language: Java</b><br></li>
<li><b>6 Tap Linear Feedback Register:</b> Designed an encrypter which reads a message from a range of locations in a register file in 8-bit ASCII format, encrypts the lower 6 bits with a 6-bit PN code, and writes the resulting encrypted message into another range of locations in the same register file. <b> Language: System Verilog</b><br></li>
<li><b>Traffic Signal:</b> Implemented a traffic signal controller for a junction with a 3-case scenario: East-West Straights, East-West Lefts, and North-South straights. Managed 6 possible states between all 3 sets of traffic lights.<b> Language: System Verilog</b> <br></li>
<li><b>Alarm Clock:</b> Implemented a conventional alarm clock, which tracks and displays hours, minutes, and seconds. Extended the alarm clock functionality to include days of the week and month and date. <b> Language: System Verilog</b><br></li>
<li><b>Nachos Operating System:</b> Designed an Operating System by implementing my own threading, scheduling, and multiprogramming functions from scratch to make a functional OS. <b> Language: Java</b><br></li>
<li><b>DNS Blocker:</b> Implemented a hash table-based in-memory database using single linked chains for collision resolution. The database contained the DNS names of websites the client wished to block. If a DNS name is found in the database, it will respond with a blocked message, and not let the host access the webpage. Sold to around 100 houses in various residential complexes in Dubai. <b> Language: C</b> <br></li>
<li><b>FP Converter:</b> Built a program that reads the file of binary 8-bit FP numbers and converted them to the IEEE Single Precision (32 bit) format.<b> Language: ARM-32</b> <br></li>
<li><b>The Game of Life:</b> Developed by John Conway, the Game of Life is a mathematical simulation of a simplified evolution process. Developed a simulation that occurs on a two-dimensional grid of cells over a series of discrete timesteps. Wrote the fastest program in a class of 250 students. <b> Language: ARM-32</b><br></li>
<li><b>ETL Program:</b> Made a custom ETL Program to process CSV files <b> Language: C</b><br></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>I graduated from UCSD with a Bachelor's in Computer Science (Cum Laude, Major GPA: 3.65) in June 2023. My educational experiences and activities predominantly involved security, networks, and systems architecture, and I had the oppurtunity to learn from great minds in their respective fields. I was also involved in various clubs and organizations, such as: <ul>
    <li>UCSD Field Hockey Club</li>
    <li>ACM Cyber</li>
    <li>Pi Kappa Alpha</li>
  </ul>
  During my free time, I like to play golf, surf, listen to music (favorite artists are Eric Clapton, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Radiohead), and read books (my current favorite authors are Fyodor Dostoevsky and Haruki Murakami) and security research papers. I am also an avid NBA fan and support Lebron James and Kawhi Leonard.
