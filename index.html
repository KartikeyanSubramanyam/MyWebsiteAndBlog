  <p>Over my 2 years as a Research Assistant, I have worked for the Aerosec group at UCSD researching security concerns in aviation as well as for the <a href="http://seelab.ucsd.edu">System Energy Efficiency Lab</a> (SeeLab) at UCSD, where I worked on accelerating Fully Homomorphic Encryption operations in Deep Neural Networks. While I cannot publicly post the work I have done with Aerosec due to matters of national and industrial security, I can still talk about my work (to a certain degree).</p>

    <li><b> Sliding Window Protocol:</b> Implemented the hosts as threads that run on my processor, and simulated the network links between these hosts (threads). Implemented Sliding Window Protocol that uses selective retransmission and cumulative ACK scheme to achieve reliable transmission of data frames and thereby enabling the receiver to populate the entire original message that the sender had sent.<b> Language: C</b><br></li>
  </ul>
  <br>
<li><b>Software Engineering</b></li>
  <ul>
    <li><b>"Birds of a Feather":</b> Led and developed a Mobile App alongside a team of 3 other developers that uses the new Nearby API to find and make friends in the same class as the user.

<blockquote>
  <p>I graduated from UCSD with a Bachelor's in Computer Science (Cum Laude, Major GPA: 3.65) in June 2023. My educational experiences and activities predominantly involved security, networks, and systems architecture, and I had the oppurtunity to learn from great minds in their respective fields. I was also involved in various clubs and organizations, such as: <ul>
    <li>UCSD Field Hockey Club</li>
    <li>ACM Cyber</li>
    <li>Pi Kappa Alpha</li>
  </ul>
  During my free time, I like to play golf, surf, listen to music (favorite artists are Eric Clapton, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Radiohead), and read books (my current favorite authors are Fyodor Dostoevsky and Haruki Murakami) and security research papers. I am also an avid NBA fan and am a massive supporter of Kobe Bryant and Kawhi Leonard.
